In addition to the `context_length` the model also takes into account the values of the time series at typical seasonal windows. For instance, for hourly data, the model will look at the value of the series 24 hours ago, one week ago, one month ago, etc. Therefore, it is not necessary to make the `context_length` span an entire month if you expect monthly seasonalities in your hourly data.\n",

When interested in quantifying the confidence of the estimates produced, then it's probabilistic forecasts that are wanted. The data you're working with is real-valued, so it is recommended to opt for the Gaussian likelihood:\n",

    "The neural network’s last hidden layer results in $h_{d,t}$. This $h_{d,t}$ will undergo 1 activation function per likelihood parameter. For example, for the Gaussian likelihood, $h_{d,t}$ is transformed by an affine activation function to get the mean:\n",

The neural network is trained to learn the fixed constants of the activation parameters. Since the $h_{d,t}$ output vary given each time-step's input, this still allows the likelihood parameters to vary over time, and therefore capture dynamic behaviors in the time series data.\n",

    "The LSTM layers are shown in <span style=\"color:red\">red</span>, and the final hidden layer produces the $h_{d,t}$ value, which, as you saw in an earlier slide, will undergo an activation function for each parameter of the specified likelihood. To learn the activation function parameters, the neural network takes the $h_{d,t}$ at time $t$ and the data up until time $t$, and performs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to yield the activation parameters which maximize the likelihood at time $t$. The <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span> output layer uses the SGD-optimized activation functions to output the maximum likelihood parameters.\n",

For the first input, it can use the data point of the current time. The input will be processed by the trained LSTM layers, and subsequently get activated by the optimized activation functions to output the maximum-likelihood theta parameters at time $t+1$. \n",

    "Now that DeepAR has completed the likelihood with its parameter estimates, DeepAR can simulate `Monte Carlo (MC) samples` from this likelihood and produce an empirical distribution for the predicted datapoint - the probabilistic forecasts shown in <span style=\"color:purple\">purple</span>. The Monte Carlo samples produced at time $t+1$ are used as input for time $t+2$, etc, until the end of the prediction horizon. In the interactive plots below, you'll see how Monte Carlo samples are able to provide us a confidence interval about the point estimate."
