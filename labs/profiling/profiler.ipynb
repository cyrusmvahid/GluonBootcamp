This helps optimize the model to run faster. In this tutorial, we will learn how to profile MXNet models to measure their running time and memory consumption using the MXNet profiler.\n\n## The incorrect way to profile\n\nIf you have just begun using MXNet, you might be tempted to measure the execution time of your model using Python's `time` module like shown below:", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from time import time\nfrom mxnet import autograd, nd\nimport mxnet as mx\n\nstart = time()\nx = nd.random_uniform(shape=(2000,2000))\ny = nd.dot(x, x)\nprint('Time for matrix multiplication: %f sec\\n' % (time() - start))\n\nstart = time()                                \nprint(y.asnumpy())                                \nprint('Time for printing the output: %f sec' % (time() - start))", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "From the output above, it seems as if printing the output takes lot more time that multiplying two large matrices. That doesn't feel right. \n\nThis is because, in MXNet, all operations are executed asynchronously. So, when `nd.dot(x, x)` returns, the matrix multiplication is not complete, it has only been queued for execution. `asnumpy` in `print(y.asnumpy())` however, waits for the result to be computed and hence takes longer time.\n\nWhile it is possible to use `NDArray.waitall()` before and after operations to get running time of operations, it is not a scalable method to measure running time of multiple sets of operations, especially in a Sequential or Hybrid network.\n\n## The correct way to profile\n\nThe correct way to measure running time of MXNet models is to use MXNet profiler. In the rest of this tutorial, we will learn how to use the MXNet profiler to measure the running time and memory consumption of MXNet models.

You can also start the profiler automatically and profile the entire code without any code changes using the `MXNET_PROFILER_AUTOSTART` environment variable.\n\nMXNet will start the profiler automatically if you run your code with the environment variable `MXNET_PROFILER_AUTOSTART` set to `1`. The profiler output is stored into `profile.json` in the current directory.\n\nNote that the profiler output could be large depending on your code. It might be helpful to profile only sections of your code using the `set_state` API described in the previous section.\n\n### Increasing granularity of the profiler output\n\nMXNet executes computation graphs in 'bulk mode' which reduces kernel launch gaps in between symbolic operators for faster execution. This could reduce the granularity of the profiler output. If you need profiling result of every operator, please set the environment variables `MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_INFERENCE` and `MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_TRAIN` to `0` to disable the bulk execution mode.\n\n### Viewing profiler output\n\nThere are two ways to view the information collected by the profiler. You can either view it in the console or you can view a more graphical version in a browser.\n\n#### 1. View in console\n\nYou can use the `profiler.dumps()` method to view the information collected by the profiler in the console.
